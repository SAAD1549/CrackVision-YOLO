# CrackVision-YOLO
Designed and developed an object detection model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to automatically detect and classify different crack types (transverse, longitudinal, diagonal) in macro sample images.
Automated Crack Type Detection Using YOLO and Roboflow
•	Leveraged Roboflow for efficient dataset annotation, augmentation, and preprocessing workflows, enabling robust model training with limited data.
•	Built a fully integrated pipeline covering data preparation in Roboflow, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
•	Impact: Dramatically improved defect detection speed and accuracy, reducing inspection time and minimizing operational costs.

Advanced Image Segmentation Research with Roboflow
•	Explored object segmentation capabilities using Roboflow's annotation and preprocessing tools, preparing datasets for advanced defect localization.
•	Experimented with YOLO segmentation variants (e.g., YOLOv8m, YOLOv11n, YOLOv11m) to precisely identify and outline defect regions.
•	Simulated real-world automated quality control scenarios by integrating segmentation results into visual analysis dashboards.
